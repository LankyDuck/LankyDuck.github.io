            var Cyber = "The Exploit:\n\tThe NotPetya attack was effectively born from an NSA list of known software exploits in the windows operating system. Instead of notifying Microsoft to fix the exploits, they said nothing, and even used the exploit for almost 5 years. (Microsoft has since called upon the NSA and other government bodies to support a Digital Geneva Convention, which calls for an end to nation-state stockpiling of software vulnerabilities)\n\tEventually, the NSA was hacked and a group known as the Shadow Brokers gained access to EternalBlue, eventually releasing it to the world. One month before the Shadow Brokers leak, Microsoft released Security Bulletin MS17-010, which was designed to fix the software flaws that EternalBlue used. This suggests that the NSA likely realized they had been hacked, and somehow Microsoft had been tipped off as to the breach and so rushed to fix the bug.\n\tAfter its release, EternalBlue was used in numerous cyber attacks, including, but not limited to the WannaCry and Petya Ransomware, and the NotPetya malware. In each of these viruses, the EternalBlue exploit is used to take advantage of SMBv1(Server Message Block Protocol) vulnerabilities present in older versions of Microsoft operating systems. SMBv1 was first developed in early 1983 as a network communication protocol to enable shared access to files, printers, and ports. (e.g a way for windows machines to talk to each other and other devices for remote services). EternalBlue takes advantage of how windows mishandles specially crafted packets from malicious attackers. All the attacker needs to do is send a maliciously crafted packet to the target server, and the malware propagates.\n\tRansomware as a whole(NotPetya included) affects both integrity and availability. It affects integrity in that the information stored on the infected machines is changed(encrypted). It affects availability in that the information is no longer available to the user."
